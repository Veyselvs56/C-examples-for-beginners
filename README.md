# C-examples-for-beginners
C++ examples I wrote from simple to medium and difficult levels
There are hundreds of examples in the text file and each example is explained with comment lines. 
I have been writing these examples since the first grade.
The main purpose of the examples is to understand the logic of C++ commands and algorithm logic.
